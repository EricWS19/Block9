        <p>My path has been anything but typical. From the intense kitchens of Auguste Escoffier to the lively buzz of Boulder's Bohemian Biergarten, and even a stint in healthcare, I've learned the value of hard work, precision, and connecting with people. Now, I'm bringing that same energy and focus to the world of coding.</p>
      
        <p>You might also catch me in a cape and cowl, volunteering as Batman for special events â€“ a passion rooted in my love for comics and a desire to make a difference. That creative spark extends to my own graphic novel project, a story I'm actively developing.</p>
      
        <p>This new coding adventure feels like a natural evolution. Just as I learned to craft a perfect dish or handle a busy Friday night crowd, I'm now eager to build elegant and effective digital solutions. With the exciting arrival of my daughter Aurora on the horizon this July, I'm more motivated than ever to create and contribute. If you're looking for someone with a diverse background, a strong work ethic, and a genuine enthusiasm for tech, let's connect!</p>
